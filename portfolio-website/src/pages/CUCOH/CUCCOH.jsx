CUCOH exposes undergraduate students to a wide array of professions in the healthcare industry through inspiring keynotes, engaging case challenges, interactive workshops and a research competition that showcase the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare.</p>
                                <p className="project__paragraph">I took the initiative to independently create an end-to-end process that would allow our delegates to feel confident in their purchase of the conference experience the rest of the team was building.</p>

                                <p className="project__paragraph">This goal was accomplished by implementing a slotting framework that enabled our team to preemptively slot delegates into our conference experiences and then by improving the way information regarding a delegatesâ€™ experience was communicated throughout their journey.</p>
